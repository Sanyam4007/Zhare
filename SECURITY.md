## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and encourage the community to responsibly disclose any potential issues they discover. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, please follow these steps to report it:

1. Go to the project's GitHub repository.
2. Create a new issue and label it as "vulnerability" or "security issue."
3. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the affected version(s) and steps to reproduce it.
4. The maintainers will review the report and respond accordingly.
5. If the vulnerability is accepted, it will be acknowledged, and the team will work on a fix.
6. Expect regular updates on the progress of the vulnerability resolution.
7. If the vulnerability report is declined, the reasons will be communicated.

We aim to address reported vulnerabilities promptly and appreciate your cooperation in responsible disclosure. To ensure the security of all users, please refrain from sharing sensitive details publicly until the maintainers have had a chance to address them.

Thank you for contributing to the security of our project!
